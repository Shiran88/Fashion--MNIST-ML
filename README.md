# Fashion--MNIST-ML:
In this exercise I trained my first neural network in a so-called data set "Fashion- MNIST". This data set contains 10 different categories of clothing.The task is to train a classifier who classifies this data.Data: Each image is 28 pixels high and 28 pixels wide, for a total Of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel value associated with it this, which indicates the lightness or darkness of that pixel. This pixel value is an integer between 0 and 255.The goal is to train a multi-layered neural network for fashion-Array MNIST.The model minimizes the likelihood of a negative diary (NLL)
